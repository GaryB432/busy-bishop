<h1>How it works</h1>
Make minor typographical corrections to a web page. Those corrections are seen by the page's owner who chooses whether to make the corrections.

<h1>How to use it</h1> 
Select a small piece of text. The selection needs to be within a single element. Right-click on the selected text and choose Suggest an edit from the context menu. On the popup dialog, enter the corrected text and click OK.

<h2>Page Owners</h2>
Click the icon in the Chrome browser bar and view the suggested edits made by the world. Make the corrections you choose and publish your page through the normal means.
