            you of the following:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom
              it may be shared.</li>
            <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
            <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
            <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</strong>
            <br>We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information
            that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information
            to anyone.</p>
          <p>We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information
            with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship
            an order.</p>
          <p>Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or
            services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your Access to and Control Over Information</strong>
            <br>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting
            us via the email address or phone number given on our website:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies</strong>
            <br>We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve
            your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify
            you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can
            also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of
            a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Security</strong>
            <br>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
            information is protected both online and offline.</p>
          <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted
            to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https"
            at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>
          <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
            Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service)
            are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally
            identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">via email</span>.</strong>
